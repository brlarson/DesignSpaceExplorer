<h1>What Is Design Space Explorer (DSE)?</h1>
<p>
Design Space Explorer (DSE) is a plug-in to OSATE for selecting particular designs from an AADL architecture model that defines a design space.
</p>
<p>
Usually, AADL architecture models define a single product.  There is a single, top-level system implementation file from which OSATE can generate
instance model files (ending in .aaxl2) with which various analysis tools can be used.  For this to work, all subcomponents of implementations must themselves be implementations.
</p>
<p>
However, AADL allows component types to have multiple implementations.  Because each of the multiple implementations has the same type, they are exactly the same externally.
When used as subcomponents, either could be used.  Suppose two (otherwise identical) processors could be used: one hot and fast
(<tt>Cpu.fast</tt>), the other cool and slow (<tt>Cpu.low_power</tt>).
</p>
<p>
Before Design Space Explorer (DSE) generating instance model files for each choice of processor required not just duplication of the implementation that has the processor as a subcomponent, 
but duplications of all implementations up to the top-level system implementation.  
While duplicating instance models all the way down may be acceptable when a single component type has two possible implementations, 
it becomes and error-prone organizational nightmare when considering multiple implementations of multiple types.  
</p>
<code>
<pre>
system Top
end Top;

--system with fast cpu
system implementation Top.impl1
  subcomponents
  	chip: processor Cpu.fast;
end Top.impl1;

--system with low-power cpu
system implementation Top.impl2
  subcomponents
  	chip: processor Cpu.low_power;
end Top.impl2;

processor Cpu
end Cpu;

processor implementation Cpu.fast		
	properties
		Physical_Properties::Power=>200.0 mW;
end  Cpu.fast;					

processor implementation Cpu.low_power	
	properties
		Physical_Properties::Power=>100.0 mW;
end  Cpu.low_power;					
</pre>
</code>
<p>
AADL itself allows subcomponents to be either types, or implementations.
</p>
<code>
<pre>
--system with just cpu type
system implementation Top.impl
  subcomponents
  	chip: processor Cpu;
end Top.impl;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
Choosing <tt>Top.impl</tt> with OSATE to make an instance model, does not make a choice for subcomponent <tt>chip</tt>.  Rather it uses the component type.  
Most AADL analysis tools insist on implementations all the way down, and in this case a power-consumption analysis would not know what value to use for <tt>Cpu</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Design Space Explorer allow selection of implementation for subcomponent types.  
Thus the AADL architecture model itself can remain coherent and compact, yet define a design space of alternatives which can be analyzed.
