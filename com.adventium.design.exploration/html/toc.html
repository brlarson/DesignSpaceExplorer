<h1>DSE makes selected AADL instance models.</h1>

<p>
The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) expresses systems-engineering models of embedded computer systems.  
AADL models computer systems that control machines, particularly safety-critical machines such as aircraft, medical devices, and automobiles.
More can be found about AADL at 
<a href="http://aadl.info">AADL.info</a>.
</p>

<p>
DSE is a plug-in to the Open-Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE), which is a plug-in to Eclipse.  If you are reading this, you have both OSATE and DSE installed.
</p>

<p>
One of the intents for AADL was to model families of devices that may be different, but related products using product-line engineering.  
Alternatively, an AADL architecture specifies a range of design choices, that is narrowed as design proceeds.  
A space-craft has limits for volume, mass, and power for which trade-offs are made.
</p>

<p>
People write AADL <i>declarative</i> models with a text editor, graphical editor, or most likely, both.  A declarative model may define a design space.
An AADL <i>instance</i> model represents a particular design choice.  Almost all of the AADL architecture analysis tools apply to instance models.
</p>

<p>
OSATE can generate instance models from declarative models by selecting (right click) a system <i>implementation</i> in the context menu. 
However, the selected component must have "implementations all the way down".
</p>

<p>
DSE provides selection of implementations of subcomponent types (when more than one is available), and choice of array sizes when 
defined as property constants in property sets.
